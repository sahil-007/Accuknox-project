1. System Health Monitoring Script: 
Develop a script that monitors the health of a Linux system. It should check CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the script should send an alert to the console or a log file.
